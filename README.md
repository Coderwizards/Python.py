Now, let's install "Python", I personally recommend Python 3.x version.

1. Go to:   www.python.org        this, the official website to install "Python".

2. Click on "Downloads" tab from the above options available.

3. There the website automatically detects, the OS of your system and show you to   download "Python" for the same i.e; in my "Download the latest version for Windows", if you not then, click on the OS your using or for your desired OS and download Python 3.x version.

4. If you have downloaded the .exe file in your system then, run it and in the setup wizard except the permission "Add Python to PATH" leave it as it is and make sure to hit the check box infront of this option.

5.  Now, you are all done with the setup and installation of the Python, Python has been successfully installed in your system, to verify (in case of Windows) open "command prompt" or press ("win key" + "r") and type "cmd", now type "python --version" you will find the current "Python" on your system.
